#This section looks at different segments of code tat could be used for building a new framework, 
# but only provides high level skeleton code and not actual framework code.

#The first code section contains Python code that is primarily focused on running tests and loading configuration data for testing purposes. 
# It is structured into two main functionalities: executing different types of tests using pytest and loading test data from a file.

#Running Tests with run_tests
#The run_tests function is designed to execute specific categories of tests based on the input argument test_type. 
# It uses Python's match-case syntax (introduced in Python 3.10) to handle different test types, 
# such as "unit", "integration", "performance", "security", and "resilience". For each test type, 
# the function invokes pytest.main() with appropriate arguments to specify verbosity (-v), 
# generate an HTML report (--html=reports/<test_type>_report.html), and target the corresponding test directory (tests/<test_type>_tests). 
# If an unrecognized test type is provided, the function prints an error message and exits the program with a non-zero status code using sys.exit(1). 
# This ensures that invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

#The script also includes a conditional block under if __name__ == "__main__", which serves as the entry point for the program. 
# It checks if the user has provided a test type as a command-line argument (sys.argv[1]). 
# If not, it prompts the user to specify one and exits. 
# This design makes the script suitable for command-line execution, allowing developers to run specific test suites conveniently.

#Loading Test Data with load_test_data
#The load_test_data function is a utility for reading JSON data from a file. 
# It opens the file in read mode ('r') and uses json.load() to parse the contents into a Python dictionary. 
# This function is reusable and can be used to load configuration files, test data, or other JSON-based resources. 

#Example Test Case
#The script includes an example test case that uses pytest's @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator to test a URL. 
# The decorator dynamically injects test data into the test function, test_example, based on the loaded environment configuration. 
# The configuration is expected to be a nested dictionary structure, where the base URL is retrieved from the default_environment key. 
# The test sends an HTTP GET request to the URL using requests.get() and asserts that the response status code is 200, indicating a successful request. 
# However, the code snippet is incomplete because the requests module is not imported, which would result in a NameError during execution.

#This section looks at Performace testing. 
#The below code defines a structure for implementing performance tests in Python, using an object-oriented approach. 
# It includes an abstract base class, PerformanceTest, and a concrete subclass, JMeterPerformanceTest. 
# Additionally, there is a YAML-like configuration snippet embedded in the code, 
# which outlines tools and configurations for performance and security testing.

#Abstract Base Class: PerformanceTest
#The PerformanceTest class serves as a blueprint for performance testing. 
# It defines three methods: setup, execute, and teardown. 
# These methods are intended to be overridden by subclasses, as they raise NotImplementedError when called. 
# This design enforces that any subclass must provide specific implementations for these methods. 
# The PerformanceTest class is an example of an abstract class in Python, which is commonly used to define a contract or interface for derived classes.

#Configuration Snippet
#The embedded configuration snippet appears to be YAML-like data, describing tools and configurations for two types of tests: performance and security. 
# For performance testing, the tool specified is "JMeter," with a configuration file located at path/to/jmeter/config.jmx. 
# For security testing, the tool is "OWASP ZAP," with its configuration file at path/to/zap/config.yaml. 
# This configuration could be used to dynamically load settings for test execution, although it is unclear how this data is integrated into the Python code.

#Concrete Subclass: JMeterPerformanceTest
#The JMeterPerformanceTest class extends PerformanceTest and provides a concrete implementation for performance testing using JMeter. 
# It introduces an __init__ method to accept a configuration file path, which is stored in the self.config attribute. 
# The setup, execute, and teardown methods are placeholders, intended to contain the logic for preparing JMeter, 
# running tests, and cleaning up afterward, respectively. 
# These methods are currently incomplete, with comments indicating where the implementation should go.

class PerformanceTest:
    def setup(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def execute(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def teardown(self):
        raise NotImplementedError


tests:
  performance:
    tool: "JMeter"
    configuration: "path/to/jmeter/config.jmx"
  security:
    tool: "OWASP ZAP"
    configuration: "path/to/zap/config.yaml"


class JMeterPerformanceTest(PerformanceTest):
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config

    def setup(self):
        # Code to prepare JMeter for execution

    def execute(self):
        # Code to run JMeter tests

    def teardown(self):
        # Code to clean up after tests



#The below code is a Python script that uses the Faker library to generate fake user data. 
# This is particularly useful for testing applications, populating databases with dummy data, or simulating user profiles in development environments.

#Importing and Initializing Faker
#The script begins by importing the Faker class from the faker library. 
# The Faker library is a popular Python package for generating fake data such as names, addresses, emails, and more. 
# After importing, an instance of Faker is created and assigned to the variable fake. 
# This instance provides access to various methods for generating different types of fake data.

#Function: generate_user_data
#The generate_user_data function is defined to return a dictionary containing three key-value pairs:

#'name': The value is generated using fake.name(), which produces a random full name.
#'email': The value is generated using fake.email(), which produces a random email address.
#'address': The value is generated using fake.address(), which produces a random address, including street, city, and postal code.
#This function encapsulates the logic for generating a user profile, making it reusable and easy to call whenever fake user data is needed.

from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

def generate_user_data():
    return {
        'name': fake.name(),
        'email': fake.email(),
        'address': fake.address(),
    }

# Example of generating test data for a user
user_data = generate_user_data()
print(user_data)


#The below code demonstrates a Python script that manages environment-specific configurations using YAML files. 
# This approach is commonly used in projects to separate configuration data for different environments, 
# such as staging and production, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

#YAML Configuration Structure
#The script begins with a YAML-like configuration snippet embedded directly in the code. 
# It defines two environments: staging and production. Each environment contains three key-value pairs:
#base_url: Specifies the base URL for the environment, such as https://staging.example.com for staging and https://prod.example.com for production.
#db_connection: Represents the database connection string for the environment.
#api_key: Stores the API key specific to the environment.

#The default_environment is set to "staging", indicating that staging is the default environment for the application.

#Loading Configuration with load_config
#The script uses the yaml library to load environment-specific configurations from external YAML files. 
# The load_config function accepts an environment parameter, constructs the file path dynamically (configs/{environment}.yaml), 
# and opens the file in read mode ('r'). 
# It then uses yaml.safe_load() to parse the YAML file and return the configuration as a Python dictionary. 
# This function is reusable and allows the application to load configurations for any environment by simply passing the environment name.

default_environment: "staging"
environments:
  staging:
    base_url: "https://staging.example.com"
    db_connection: "staging-db"
    api_key: "staging-api-key"
  production:
    base_url: "https://prod.example.com"
    db_connection: "prod-db"
    api_key: "prod-api-key"



import yaml

def load_config(environment):
    with open(f'configs/{environment}.yaml', 'r') as file:
        return yaml.safe_load(file)

# Load configuration for the staging environment
config = load_config('staging')
print(config['base_url'])
