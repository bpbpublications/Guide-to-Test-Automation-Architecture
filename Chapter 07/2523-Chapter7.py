#The below code demonstrates the use of Python's unittest.mock library to create and utilize mock objects in testing. 
# Mock objects are useful for simulating the behavior of complex dependencies or external systems, 
# allowing tests to focus on specific functionality without requiring the actual implementation of those dependencies.

#Mock Object Creation:
#The code begins by creating a mock object named api_mock using the Mock class from the unittest.mock module. 
# This mock object can simulate the behavior of any object or function, and its behavior can be customized as needed. 
# In this case, the get_data method of the mock object is configured to return a predefined value, {'key': 'value'}, whenever it is called. 
# This is achieved using the return_value attribute.

#Using the Mock in a Test:
#The mock object is then used in a test scenario. The get_data method is called on the mock object, 
# and the returned value is stored in the response variable. 
# The test includes an assertion (assert response == {'key': 'value'}) to verify that the returned value matches the expected result. 
# Since the mock's behavior was explicitly defined earlier, this assertion will pass.

#Verifying Mock Behavior:
#The final line of the code uses the assert_called_once_with method to verify that the get_data method of the mock object was called exactly 
# once with a specific argument, expected_param. 
# This is a common practice in testing to ensure that the mock object was used correctly and that the expected interactions occurred. 
# However, the variable expected_param is not defined, which would result in a NameError if executed. 
# This is because the code incomplete and an expected_param should be defined elsewhere to complete the test.

from unittest.mock import Mock

# Create a mock object
api_mock = Mock()
api_mock.get_data.return_value = {'key': 'value'}

# Use the mock in a test
response = api_mock.get_data()
assert response == {'key': 'value'}


api_mock.get_data.assert_called_once_with(expected_param)


#The below code demonstrates the use of a stub class, DatabaseStub, to simulate database interactions in a testing scenario. 
# Stubs are simplified implementations of components or systems that provide predefined responses, 
# allowing developers to test specific functionality without relying on external systems like databases.

#DatabaseStub Class:
#The DatabaseStub class contains a single method, fetch_user, which simulates fetching user data from a database. 
# Instead of performing an actual database query, the method returns a hardcoded dictionary containing the user's ID (user_id) 
# and a placeholder name ('Test User'). 
# This approach is useful for testing because it eliminates the need for a real database connection, making tests faster and more predictable.

#Using the Stub in a Test:
#The code creates an instance of the DatabaseStub class (db_stub) and calls its fetch_user method with a user ID of 1. 
# The returned dictionary is stored in the variable user. 
# The test then includes an assertion (assert user['name'] == 'Test User') to verify that the name field in the returned dictionary matches 
# the expected value, 'Test User'. 
# Since the stub always returns the same hardcoded data, this assertion will pass.

class DatabaseStub:
    def fetch_user(self, user_id):
        return {'id': user_id, 'name': 'Test User'}

# Using the stub in a test
db_stub = DatabaseStub()
user = db_stub.fetch_user(1)
assert user['name'] == 'Test User'

#The below code demonstrates the use of a fake database implemented as the FakeDatabase class. 
# This class serves as a lightweight, in-memory representation of a database, designed for testing purposes. 
# It allows developers to simulate basic database operations, such as adding and retrieving users, without relying on an actual database system.

#FakeDatabase Class:
#The FakeDatabase class is structured to mimic the behavior of a simple database. It contains:

#Initialization (__init__): The constructor initializes an empty dictionary, self.users, which acts as the storage for user data. 
# Each user is stored as a key-value pair, where the key is the user_id and the value is the user's name.
#add_user Method: This method allows adding a user to the fake database. 
# It takes two parameters, user_id and name, and stores them in the self.users dictionary. 
# If a user with the same user_id already exists, their name will be overwritten.
#get_user Method: This method retrieves a user's name based on their user_id. 
# It uses the dictionary's get method, which returns the value associated with the key if it exists, or None if the key is not found.
#Using the Fake Database in a Test:
#The code demonstrates how the FakeDatabase class can be used in a test scenario:

#An instance of FakeDatabase is created (fake_db).
#The add_user method is called to add a user with user_id of 1 and a name of 'Test User'.
#The get_user method is then used to retrieve the name of the user with user_id of 1.
#An assertion (assert fake_db.get_user(1) == 'Test User') verifies that the retrieved name matches the expected value, 'Test User'. 
# Since the fake database correctly stores and retrieves user data, this assertion will pass.


class FakeDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = {}

    def add_user(self, user_id, name):
        self.users[user_id] = name

    def get_user(self, user_id):
        return self.users.get(user_id, None)

# Using the fake database in a test
fake_db = FakeDatabase()
fake_db.add_user(1, 'Test User')
assert fake_db.get_user(1) == 'Test User'


#The below code demonstrates a basic structure for writing unit tests in Python using the unittest framework. 
# This framework is part of Python's standard library and provides tools for creating and running tests to verify the correctness of code.

#TestExample Class:
#The TestExample class inherits from unittest.TestCase, which is the base class for all test cases in the unittest framework. 
# By extending this class, TestExample gains access to various testing utilities, such as assertions and lifecycle methods.

#Lifecycle Methods:
#setUp Method:

#This method is automatically called before each test method in the class is executed.
#It is typically used to prepare any data or state needed for the tests. 
# In this example, setUp initializes self.test_data with a dictionary containing a single key-value pair ({'key': 'value'}).
#This ensures that each test starts with a clean and consistent setup.
#tearDown Method:

#Although it is defined outside the class in the provided code (which is incorrect and would cause a syntax error), 
# the tearDown method is intended to reset or clean up any state after a test method finishes execution.
#In this example, it resets self.test_data to an empty dictionary ({}), ensuring that no leftover state affects subsequent tests.
#Test Method:
#test_example:
#This is a test method, identified by its name starting with test_. The unittest framework automatically recognizes such methods as test cases.
#The method uses the assertEqual assertion to verify that the value associated with the key 'key' in self.test_data is equal to 'value'.
#If the assertion passes, the test is considered successful; otherwise, it fails, and an error is reported.

import unittest

class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.test_data = {'key': 'value'}  # Prepare test data

    def test_example(self):
        self.assertEqual(self.test_data['key'], 'value')


def tearDown(self):
    self.test_data = {}  # Reset test data


#The below different samples of code demonstrate a comprehensive approach to loading test data from various sources 
# and formats to execute tests for product pricing logic. 
# Each section of the code handles a different data source, 
# showcasing the flexibility of Python in working with diverse data formats and storage mechanisms.

#CSV File Handling:
#The first section uses the csv module to read test data from a CSV file (test_data.csv). 
# The csv.DictReader is employed to parse the file into a dictionary-like structure, 
# where each row is represented as a dictionary with column names as keys. 
# The loop iterates through each row, extracting the product and expected_price fields for testing. 
# This approach is ideal for structured tabular data stored in plain text files.

#JSON File Handling:
#The second section reads test data from a JSON file (test_data.json) using the json module. 
# The json.load function parses the file into a Python dictionary. 
# The code then iterates through the test_cases list, extracting the product and expected_price fields for each test case. 
# JSON is a popular format for hierarchical or nested data, making it suitable for more complex test scenarios.

#XML File Handling:
#The third section processes test data stored in an XML file (test_data.xml) using the xml.etree.ElementTree module. 
# The ET.parse function loads the XML file, and the findall method retrieves all test_case elements. 
# For each test case, the find method extracts the product and expected_price values. 
# XML is often used for structured data with a defined schema, and this approach is effective for parsing such data.

#SQLite Database Handling:
#The fourth section retrieves test data from an SQLite database (test_data.db) using the sqlite3 module. 
# A connection to the database is established, and a SQL query (SELECT product, expected_price FROM product_tests) fetches the relevant data. 
# The loop iterates through the query results, extracting the product and expected_price values. 
# Using a database is advantageous for managing large datasets and performing complex queries.

#API Data Handling:
#The final section fetches test data from a remote API (https://api.example.com/testdata) using the requests module. 
# The requests.get function sends an HTTP GET request to the API, and the response is parsed as JSON using the response.json method. 
# The code then iterates through the cases list, extracting the product and expected_price fields. 
# This approach is useful for dynamic or real-time data retrieval from external services.

with open('test_data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)

        # Execute test for product pricing logic

#The below code switches to Java demonstrates two approaches to parameterized testing in Java, using two popular testing frameworks: JUnit and TestNG. 
# Both examples focus on testing login functionality with multiple sets of username-password pairs.

#JUnit Parameterized Testing:
#The first part of the code uses JUnit's Parameterized runner to implement parameterized tests. 
# Parameterized tests allow you to run the same test logic with different sets of input data.

#Annotations:

#@RunWith(Parameterized.class): Specifies that the test class should use the Parameterized test runner, enabling parameterized testing.
#@Parameterized.Parameter: Declares variables (username and password) that will hold the input data for each test iteration. 
# The optional index specifies the position of the parameter in the data array.
#Data Source:

#The data() method, annotated with @Parameterized.Parameters, provides the input data for the test. 
# It returns a collection of object arrays, where each array represents a set of test inputs (e.g., {"user1", "pass1"}).
#Test Method:

#The testLogin() method contains the test logic. For each set of input data, the test is executed with the corresponding username and password.
#This approach is useful for testing scenarios where the same logic needs to be validated against multiple input combinations.

#TestNG Data-Driven Testing:
#The second part of the code uses TestNG's @DataProvider annotation to achieve similar functionality. 
# TestNG provides a more flexible way to supply test data.

#Data Provider:

#The createData() method, annotated with @DataProvider, defines the test data. 
# It returns a two-dimensional array of objects, where each inner array represents a set of inputs (e.g., {"user1", "pass1"}).
#The name attribute of the @DataProvider annotation assigns a name (loginData) to the data provider, which can be referenced in test methods.
#Test Method:

#The testLogin() method is annotated with @Test(dataProvider = "loginData"), linking it to the loginData provider. 
# The method accepts parameters (username and password) corresponding to the data provided by the DataProvider.
#TestNG's data-driven testing is particularly useful for scenarios requiring dynamic or external data sources, 
# as @DataProvider can load data from files, databases, or APIs.


#Java Code
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.junit.runners.Parameterized;

@RunWith(Parameterized.class)
public class LoginTest {
    @Parameterized.Parameter
    public String username;
    @Parameterized.Parameter(1)
    public String password;

    @Parameterized.Parameters
    public static Collection<Object[]> data() {
        return Arrays.asList(new Object[][] {
            {"user1", "pass1"},
            {"user2", "pass2"},
            {"user3", "pass3"},
        });
    }

    @Test
    public void testLogin() {
        // Perform login test with username and password
    }
}


import org.testng.annotations.DataProvider;
import org.testng.annotations.Test;

        return new Object[][] {
            {"user1", "pass1"},
            {"user2", "pass2"},
            {"user3", "pass3"},
        };

#The below code switches back to Python and demonstrates the use of pytest, a popular Python testing framework, to implement parameterized testing. 
# Parameterized testing allows you to run the same test function multiple times with different sets of input data, 
# ensuring comprehensive coverage of various scenarios.

#Key Components:
#Importing pytest: The pytest module is imported to enable the use of its features, including the @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator, 
# which is central to parameterized testing.

#Parameterized Test:

#The @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator is used to define multiple sets of input data for the test_login function. It takes two arguments:
#A string specifying the parameter names ("username,password"), separated by commas.
#A list of tuples, where each tuple represents a set of input values for the parameters (username and password). 
# For example, ("user1", "pass1") is one set of inputs.
#This setup ensures that the test_login function is executed three times, once for each pair of username and password.
#Test Function:

#The test_login function accepts username and password as arguments, 
# which are populated with the values from the parameterized data during each test iteration.
#The actual login test logic is not provided in the code snippet, but this is where you would implement the functionality to test login behavior, 
# such as verifying credentials or simulating login attempts.

#pytest
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("username,password", [
    ("user1", "pass1"),
    ("user2", "pass2"),
    ("user3", "pass3"),
])
def test_login(username, password):
    # Perform login test with username and password


#The below code demonstrates a test case written in Robot Framework, a keyword-driven automation testing framework. 
# This example focuses on performing login tests using data retrieved from a CSV file. R
# obot Framework is known for its human-readable syntax, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

#Settings Section:
#The *** Settings *** section specifies the libraries and resources required for the test. 
# In this case, the OperatingSystem library is imported, which provides keywords for interacting with the operating system. 
# While the library is included, it is not directly used in the provided code snippet, suggesting it may be part of a broader test suite.

#Variables Section:
#The *** Variables *** section defines reusable variables. Here, ${DATA_FILE} is set to test_data.csv, 
# which represents the path to the CSV file containing the test data. 
# Using variables ensures flexibility and maintainability, as the file path can be updated in one place without modifying the test case logic.

#Test Cases Section:
#The *** Test Cases *** section contains the actual test logic. 
# The test case, named Login Test, is designed to iterate through rows of data from the CSV file and log the username and password for each row.

#Documentation: The [Documentation] tag provides a description of the test case, explaining its purpose. 
# This is a best practice in Robot Framework to make tests self-explanatory.

#Data Retrieval: The @{data} variable is populated using the Get CSV Data keyword, which reads the contents of the CSV file specified by ${DATA_FILE}. 
# Each row of the CSV file is stored as a list within the @{data} variable.

#Iteration: The :FOR loop iterates over each row in @{data}. The IN keyword specifies the iterable, and ${row} represents the current row being processed.
# Robot Framework's syntax for loops is straightforward and easy to follow.

#Logging: Within the loop, the Log keyword is used to output the username and password from the current row. 
# The syntax ${row}[0] and ${row}[1] accesses the first and second elements of the row, respectively, corresponding to the username and password.

#Use Case:
#This test case is ideal for scenarios where login functionality needs to be validated against multiple sets of credentials stored in a CSV file. 
# It demonstrates how Robot Framework can integrate external data sources into automated tests.
